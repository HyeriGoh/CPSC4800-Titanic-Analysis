### How users can get started with the project
  #### Hypothesis 1: the survival rate is associated to the class of passenger
  I categorized all dadta by Pclass and calculated both the number of survivlas in each class and the       total number of passengers in each class. Then, 
  Since the Pclass is a categorical variable and survival rate is a numerical variable
  #### Hypothesis 2: the survival rate is associated to the gender


  #### Hypothesis 3: the survival rate is associated to the age
