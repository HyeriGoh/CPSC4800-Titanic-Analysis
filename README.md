# CPSC4800-Titanic-Analysis

### Why do we need to analyze the Titanic data

### How users can get started with the project
  #### Hypothesis 1: the survival rate is associated to the class of passenger
  I categorized all dadta by Pclass and cointed both the number of survivlas in each class and the total number of passengers in each         class. Then, I calculated the survival rate. Since the Pclass is a categorical variable and survival rate is a numerical variable, Bar     graph with Pcalss on x axis is the most proper plot to show data.
  
  #### Hypothesis 2: the survival rate is associated to the gender
  Similarly to hypothesis 1, I divided data into two categories which are 'female' and 'male' and derived the survival rate for each sub     categories. To compare and show difference between sub categories clearly, I used bar graph.

  #### Hypothesis 3: the survival rate is associated to the age
